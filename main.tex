% Notes on compile / setting order:
% For the correct display of the layout and the bibliographies (multibib) please compile as follows (see "Order of compilation operations"):
%
%- Windows 10: via the PowerShell or command prompt (cmd).
% To do this, go to the folder of this project, do not select any file, click on an empty space with the left mouse button and open the context menu while holding down the Shift key (Shift key + right mouse click) and select "Open PowerShell window here". Then enter "cmd" and call the compile processes individually as follows (see "Order of compilation operations"):
%
%- macOS Big Sur 11.0.1: via the terminal.
% To do this, go to the parent folder of this project and select the folder in which the project is located. Now open the context menu (secondary click) by pressing Control + mouse button or tapping with two fingers on the trackpad. Now select "New Terminal at Folder" and call up the compile processes individually as follows:
%

% Both \citep and \citet are defined by natbib and are thus not standard. The standard LATEX command \cite should be avoided, because it behaves like \citet for author–year citations, but like \citep for numerical ones
% Quoting from the bibliography "Literature.bib": "\citet{<ID>}" respectively "\citep{<ID>}"
% Quoting from the bibliography "Own_journal_papers.bib": "\citetjournal{<ID>}" respectively "\citepjournal{<ID>}"
% Quoting from the bibliography "Own_conference_papers.bib": "\citetconference{<ID>}" respectively "\citepconference{<ID>}"

% Quotation marks
% You form the English introductory quotation marks in LaTeX with two acute accents one after the other, i.e. with the characters `` (shift+´).
% Complete your English quote with two apostrophes in a row. So you write the sign '' (shift+#).

% By default, all titles / references are output in the bibliographies. If only the quoted titles / references are to be output in the bibliography, the command "\nocite{*}" or "\nocitejournal{*} or "\nociteconference{*} "must be commented out in the file "./Inhalt/Literaturverzeichnis.tex"
