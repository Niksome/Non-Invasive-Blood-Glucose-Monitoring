	abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an uncomplicated and inexpensive optical measurement method that is often used for heart rate monitoring purposes. PPG is a non-invasive technology that uses a light source and a photodetector at the surface of skin to measure the volumetric variations of blood circulation. Recently, there has been much interest from numerous researchers around the globe to extract further valuable information from the PPG signal in addition to heart rate estimation and pulse oxymetry readings. PPG signal’s second derivative wave contains important health-related information. Thus, analysis of this waveform can help researchers and clinicians to evaluate various cardiovascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Moreover, investigating the second derivative wave of PPG signal can also assist in early detection and diagnosis of various cardiovascular illnesses that may possibly appear later in life. For early recognition and analysis of such illnesses, continuous and real-time monitoring is an important approach that has been enabled by the latest technological advances in sensor technology and wireless communications. The aim of this article is to briefly consider some of the current developments and challenges of wearable PPG-based monitoring technologies and then to discuss some of the potential applications of this technology in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop a system that can measure the blood glucose level in a non-invasive way. Since blood glucose is an important indicator of health issues, frequent blood glucose measurement is required by a great number of people. Non-invasive methods are getting popular for such measurements since painful collection of blood is not required. In non-invasive methods, blood glucose level is recorded by exploiting the relationship of blood glucose level with various biological signals and parameters. This paper addresses the relationship of glucose level with PPG (photoplethysmoram) signal which can provide information regarding the volume of blood flowing in the test region through exposure of that particular region to infrared light of certain wavelengths. A dataset has been created by collecting the PPG signal of 30 people along with their blood glucose level, measured in invasive way both before and 2 hours after breakfast. A CNN model has been trained with this dataset to exploit the relationship of glucose level with PPG signal and thus the glucose level of blood have been measured. Results obtained from our system have been compared with corresponding glucose level,recorded in invasive way.},

	abstract = {Accurate and continuous blood glucose monitoring is essential for effective diabetes management, yet traditional finger pricking methods are often inconvenient and painful. To address this issue, photoplethysmography (PPG) presents a promising non-invasive alternative for estimating blood glucose levels. In this study, we propose an innovative 1-second signal segmentation method and evaluate the performance of three advanced deep learning models using a novel dataset to estimate blood glucose levels from PPG signals. We also extend our testing to additional datasets to assess the robustness of our models against unseen distributions, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation of the models’ generalizability and specificity and accuracy. Initially, we analyzed 10-second PPG segments; however, our newly developed 1-second signal segmentation technique proved to significantly enhance accuracy and computational efficiency. The selected model, after being optimized and deployed on an embedded device, achieved immediate blood glucose estimation with a processing time of just 6.4 seconds, demonstrating the method’s practical applicability. The method demonstrated strong generalizability across different populations. Training data was collected during surgery and anesthesia, and the method also performed successfully in normal states using a separate test dataset. The results showed an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 19.7 mg/dL, with 76.6\% accuracy within the A zone and 23.4\% accuracy within the B zone of the Clarke Error Grid Analysis (CEGA), indicating a 100\% clinical acceptance. These findings demonstrate that blood glucose estimation using 1-second PPG signal segments not only outperforms the traditional 10-second segments, but also provides a more convenient and accurate alternative to conventional monitoring methods. The study’s results highlight the potential of this approach for non-invasive, accurate, and convenient diabetes management, ultimately offering improved health management.},

	abstract = {Monitoring diabetes saves lives. To this end, we introduce a novel, unobtrusive, and readily deployable in-ear device for the continuous and non-invasive measurement of blood glucose levels (BGLs). The device is equipped with a low-cost commercially available pulse oximeter whose infrared wavelength (880 nm) is used for the acquisition of photoplethysmography (PPG). For rigor, we considered a full range of diabetic conditions (non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, type I diabetic, and type II diabetic). Recordings spanned nine different days, starting in the morning while fasting, up to a minimum of a two-hour period after eating a carbohydrate-rich breakfast. The BGLs from PPG were estimated using a suite of regression-based machine learning models, which were trained on characteristic features of PPG cycles pertaining to high and low BGLs. The analysis shows that, as desired, an average of 82\% of the BGLs estimated from PPG lie in region A of the Clarke error grid (CEG) plot, with 100\% of the estimated BGLs in the clinically acceptable CEG regions A and B. These results demonstrate the potential of the ear canal as a site for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring.},

	abstract = {For the last two decades, pulse oximetry has been used as a standard procedure for monitoring arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). However, SpO2 measurements made from extremities such as the finger, ear lobe and toes become susceptible to inaccuracies when peripheral perfusion is compromised. To overcome these limitations, the external auditory canal has been proposed as an alternative monitoring site for estimating SpO2, on the hypothesis that this central site will be better perfused. Therefore, a dual wavelength optoelectronic probe along with a processing system was developed to investigate the suitability of measuring photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals and SpO2 in the human auditory canal. A pilot study was carried out in 15 healthy volunteers to validate the feasibility of measuring PPGs and SpO2 from the ear canal (EC), and comparative studies were performed by acquiring the same signals from the left index finger (LIF) and the right index finger (RIF) in conditions of induced peripheral vasoconstriction (right hand immersion in ice water). Good quality baseline PPG signals with high signal-to-noise ratio were obtained from the EC, the LIF and the RIF sensors. During the ice water immersion, significant differences in the amplitude of the red and infrared PPG signals were observed from the RIF and the LIF sensors. The average drop in amplitude of red and infrared PPG signals from the RIF was 52.7\% and 58.3\%. Similarly, the LIF PPG signal amplitudes have reduced by 47.52\% and 46.8\% respectively. In contrast, no significant changes were seen in the red and infrared EC PPG amplitude measurements, which changed by +2.5\% and -1.2\% respectively. The RIF and LIF pulse oximeters have failed to estimate accurate SpO2 in seven and four volunteers respectively, while the EC pulse oximeter has only failed in one volunteer. These results suggest that the EC may be a suitable site for reliable monitoring of PPGs and SpO2s even in the presence of peripheral vasoconstriction.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This work presents a system for a simultaneous non-invasive estimate of the blood glucose level (BGL) and the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, using a photoplethysmograph (PPG) and machine learning techniques. The method is independent of the person whose values are being measured and does not need calibration over time or subjects.
METHODOLOGY: The architecture of the system consists of a photoplethysmograph sensor, an activity detection module, a signal processing module that extracts features from the PPG waveform, and a machine learning algorithm that estimates the SBP, DBP and BGL values. The idea that underlies the system is that there is functional relationship between the shape of the PPG waveform and the blood pressure and glucose levels.
RESULTS: As described in this paper we tested this method on 410 individuals without performing any personalized calibration. The results were computed after cross validation. The machine learning techniques tested were: ridge linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, support vector machines and random forests. The best results were obtained with the random forest technique. In the case of blood pressure, the resulting coefficients of determination for reference vs. prediction were R(SBP)(2)=0.91, R(DBP)(2)=0.89, and R(BGL)(2)=0.90. For the glucose estimation, distribution of the points on a Clarke error grid placed 87.7\% of points in zone A, 10.3\% in zone B, and 1.9\% in zone D. Blood pressure values complied with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society.
CONCLUSION: An effective system for estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph is presented. The main advantage of the system is that for clinical use it complies with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society for the blood pressure and only in 1.9\% of the cases did not detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.},

Reliable determination of cardiovascular and pulmonary system information can explore the use of hearables for physiological monitoring. Recent research shows that photoplethysmography (PPG) signals not only contain details on oxygen saturation level (SPO2) but also carry more physiological information including pulse rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, and arterial-related information. The analysis of the PPG signal from the ear has proven to be reliable and accurate in the research setting. (1) Background: The present integrative review explores the existing literature on an in-ear PPG signal and its application. This review aims to identify the current technology and usage of in-ear PPG and existing evidence on in-ear PPG in physiological monitoring. This review also analyzes in-ear (PPG) measurement configuration and principle, waveform characteristics, processing technology, and feature extraction characteristics. (2) Methods: We performed a comprehensive search to discover relevant in-ear PPG articles published until December 2022. The following electronic databases: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed were utilized to conduct the studies addressing the evidence of in-ear PPG in physiological monitoring. (3) Results: Fourteen studies were identified but nine studies were finalized. Eight studies were on different principles and configurations of hearable PPG, and eight studies were on processing technology and feature extraction and its evidence in in-ear physiological monitoring. We also highlighted the limitations and challenges of using in-ear PPG in physiological monitoring. (4) Conclusions: The available evidence has revealed the future of in-ear PPG in physiological monitoring. We have also analyzed the potential limitation and challenges that in-ear PPG will face in processing the signal.},

	abstract = {For many years, pulse oximetry has been widely used in the clinical environment for a reliable monitoring of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate. But since common sensors are mainly placed to peripheral body parts as finger or earlobe, it is still highly susceptible to reduced peripheral perfusion, e.g., due to centralization. Therefore, a novel in-ear pulse oximetric sensor (placed against the tragus) was presented in a prior work which is deemed to be independent from perfusion fluctuations due to its proximity to the trunk. Having demonstrated the feasibility of in-ear SpO2 measurement with reliable specificity in a laboratory setting, we now report results from a study on in-ear SpO2 in a clinical setting. For this, trials were performed on 29 adult patients undergoing surgery. In-ear SpO2 data are compared with SpO2 data obtained by blood gas analysis, and with three reference pulse oximeters applied to the finger, ear lobe, and forehead. In addition, we derived an SpO2-independent perfusion index by means of the wavelengths used. The feasibility and robustness of in-ear SpO2 measurement is demonstrated under challenging clinical conditions. SpO2 shows good accordance with SpO2, a high level of comparability with the reference pulse oximeters, and was significantly improved by introducing a new algorithm for artifact reduction. The perfusion index also shows a good correlation with the reference data.},

A review of the history shows that the term "diabetes" was first used by Apollonius of Memphis around 250 to 300 BC. Ancient Greek, Indian, and Egyptian civilizations discovered the sweet nature of urine in this condition, and hence the propagation of the word Diabetes Mellitus came into being. Mering and Minkowski, in 1889, discovered the role of the pancreas in the pathogenesis of diabetes. In 1922 Banting, Best, and Collip purified the hormone insulin from the pancreas of cows at the University of Toronto, leading to the availability of an effective treatment for diabetes in 1922. Over the years, exceptional work has taken place, and multiple discoveries, as well as management strategies, have been created to tackle this growing problem. Unfortunately, even today, diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases in the country and worldwide. In the US, it remains as the seventh leading cause of death.},

	abstract = {Individuals exhibiting precursor symptoms of diabetes mellitus or reaching diagnostic thresholds for diabetes are at increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Moreover, patients with diabetes alone, as well as those who have diabetes paired with established CVD, remain undertreated for cardiovascular risk factors. The clear correlation between these disease processes has led many to speculate that they share common pathogenetic processes. Recent research has made it increasingly evident that the core metabolic defects that mark diabetes, including impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and proinflammatory and prothrombotic states, lead to endothelial dysfunction and accelerate atherogenesis. Moreover, increases in sympathetic tone with diabetes are associated with changes in cardiac and vascular function that lead to hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac autonomic neuropathy; such changes set the stage for arrhythmia, silent infarction, and sudden death. Furthermore, diabetes-related changes in metabolic and autonomic functioning, as well as increases in inflammatory and thrombotic signaling, compromise the ability of myocardial and vascular tissue to remodel after injury and to recover and sustain functionality. Because potentiation of atherogenesis and cardiac dysfunction occurs in the presence of early diabetic symptoms as well as in the established disease, early implementation of strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and to slow diabetes progression may help to improve long-term outcomes for at-risk individuals. Such interventions may include well-established treatments for hypertension and dyslipidemia, diet improvements, weight loss, and exercise as well as novel pharmacologic interventions aimed at newly identified therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in 25\%-40\% of patients with diabetes. Given the dual problems of a significant risk of progression from DKD to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, it is important to identify patients at risk of DKD and ESRD and initiate protective renal and cardiovascular therapies. The importance of preventive therapy is emphasized further by worldwide increases in the incidence of diabetes. This review summarizes the evidence regarding the prognostic value and benefits of targeting established and novel risk markers for DKD development and progression. Family history of DKD, smoking history, and glycemic, blood pressure, and plasma lipid level control are established factors for identifying people at greatest risk of DKD development and progression. Absolute albumin excretion rate (AER) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurements also are important, although AER categorization generally lacks the necessary specificity and sensitivity, and estimates of declining GFR are compromised by methodological limitations for GFRs in the normal-to-high range. Emerging risk markers for progressive loss of kidney function include markers of oxidation and inflammation, profibrotic cytokines, uric acid, advanced glycation end products, functional and structural markers of vascular dysfunction, kidney structural changes, and tubular biomarkers. Among these, the most promising are serum uric acid and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (type 1 and type 2) levels, especially in relation to GFR changes. At present, these can only be considered as risk markers because they only identify an individual at increased risk of progressive DKD and not necessarily related to the causal pathway promoting kidney damage. Further work is needed to establish whether modulating these factors improves the prognosis in DKD. Although change in urinary peptidome levels also is a promising marker, there currently is neither a clinical assay nor adequate studies defining its prognostic value. Until these or other novel markers become available for clinical use, predictive accuracy often may be increased with greater attention to established markers.},

	abstract = {Diabetic-induced peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a highly complex and frequent diabetic late complication, which is manifested by prolonged hyperglycemia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of nerve damage and sensory loss remain largely unclear. Recently, alteration in metabolic flux has gained attention as a basis for organ damage in diabetes; however, peripheral sensory neurons have not been adequately analyzed with respect to metabolic dysfunction. In the present study, we attempted to delineate the sequence of event occurring in alteration of metabolic pathways in relation to nerve damage and sensory loss. C57Bl6/j wild-type mice were analyzed longitudinally up to 22 weeks in the streptozotocin (STZ) model of type 1 diabetes. The progression of DPN was investigated by behavioral measurements of sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli and quantitative morphological assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. We employed a mass spectrometry-based screen to address alterations in levels of metabolites in peripheral sciatic nerve and amino acids in serum over several months post-STZ administration to elucidate metabolic dysfunction longitudinally in relation to sensory dysfunction. Although hyperglycemia and body weight changes occurred early, sensory loss and reduced intraepithelial branching of nociceptive nerves were only evident at 22 weeks post-STZ. The longitudinal metabolites screen in peripheral nerves demonstrated that compared with buffer-injected age-matched control mice, mice at 12 and 22 weeks post-STZ showed an early impairment the tricaoboxylic acid (TCA cycle), which is the main pathway of carbohydrate metabolism leading to energy generation. We found that levels of citric acid, ketoglutaric acid (2 KG), succinic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid were observed to be significantly reduced in sciatic nerve at 22 weeks post-STZ. In addition, we also found the increase in levels of sorbitol and L-lactate in peripheral nerve from 12 weeks post-STZ injection. Amino acid screen in serum showed that the amino acids valine (Val), isoleucine (Ile), and leucine (Leu), grouped together as BCAA, increased more than twofold from 12 weeks post-STZ. Similarly, the levels of tyrosine (Tyr), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), histidine (His), alanine (Ala), and proline (Pro) showed progressive increase with progression of diabetes. Our results indicate that the impaired TCA cycle metabolites in peripheral nerve are the primary cause of shunting metabolic substrate to compensatory pathways, which leads to sensory nerve fiber loss in skin and contribute to onset and progression of peripheral neuropathy.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is becoming more prevalent over the world, with approximately 7.8 million new cases diagnosed each year. The most crucial aspect of diabetes therapy is frequent glucose monitoring; the one and only way diabetics can maintain healthy blood sugar standard is through diet and exercise. Blood glucose monitoring techniques have gone through massive transformations over the past few years. Non-invasive procedures outperform invasive and minimally invasive ones in terms of inconvenience, pain, and recovery time. Thus, this review aims to explore the latest tools for non-invasive glucose monitoring sensors and techniques. The study showed that non-invasive techniques such as optical and non-optical techniques are better than invasive techniques in terms of accuracy, reliability, repeatability, and ease of use. The study also uncovered that the photoacoustic spectroscopy and ultrasonic techniques have room for further development and advancement considering their flexible nature. The work also proved that the ultrasonic technique is the most promising approach, in conclusion.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of diabetes is rising every year, and the present ways of keeping track of blood glucose levels are intrusive, costly, and painful. The study presents a comprehensive analysis of developments in glucose monitoring devices focusing on the topic of diabetes. This study shows the usefulness of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) in the management of diabetes, which is again a strong reason for preferring Non-invasive(NI) measurements over the more conventional but less comfortable invasive ones. For glucose monitoring, the study incessantly characterizes the current and developing technologies between invasive, minimally, and noninvasive technologies as well as providing an overview of the advancement, existing, and used commercial applications for each category. The systematic review involved browsing databases such as the ACM Digital Library, Elsevier Library, WOS, and IEEE, whereby after going through 320 related papers the study highlighted 41 quality papers. The application of Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring (NIBGM) technologies such as optical, microwave, and nano-based sensors are representative of an effective way to improve diabetes care due to their painless and continuous characteristics. In addition, the current research has given a details discussion of innovations such as smart wearables, breath analyzers, and saliva-based sensors that have been introduced recently in the market and explore future research areas that may improve the accuracy, selectivity, and sensitivity of the NIBGM devices. This work is special since the International Diabetes Federation estimates three hundred and twenty-two million people living with type II diabetes, and it leads to 1. 5 million deaths annually. Despite the standard single-CGM systems’ excellent accuracy, the findings indicate that combining them with numerous NI techniques could lead to a better, more dependable, and more affordable solution. This, in turn, would improve patient compliance and quality of life.},
